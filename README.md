"Unlocking the Future: AI Impact on Industries and Jobs - A Text Corpus Analysis"

In this groundbreaking final project, we delve into the exciting world of AI and its potential impact on industries and job markets over the coming years. Leveraging a curated collection of ~200K news articles (about 900 MB) focusing on Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, we aim to extract meaningful insights from unstructured text and shed light on which tasks and job lines are most likely to be profoundly affected by AI advancements.

With the aid of cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we explore the connections between AI advancements and their potential applications across various sectors. Through text mining and analysis, we identify key patterns, trends, and transformative technologies, such as AI for image generation and Conversational AI, that are driving the paradigm shift in the adoption of AI technologies and data science.

Our primary objective is to provide actionable recommendations based on our findings. We seek to empower businesses and policymakers with valuable insights into how AI can be harnessed to automate tasks, streamline workflows, and enhance employee productivity across different industries. By understanding the industries and job lines most susceptible to AI disruption, stakeholders can make informed decisions on workforce planning, reskilling initiatives, and investment strategies to stay ahead in this rapidly evolving landscape.

Our project aims to address Moravec's paradox, which highlights the challenges in AI focusing on sensorimotor skills rather than abstract thought or reasoning. By understanding the nuances and limitations of AI technology, we can identify areas where human expertise and collaboration will remain vital and areas where AI can significantly augment human capabilities.
